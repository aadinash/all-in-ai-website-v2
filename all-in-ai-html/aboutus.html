            <h4>Aadi Nashikkar</h4>
            <p class="contentp">In 9th grade, I wanted to learn AI. Unfortunately, few courses were designed for beginners. The few courses intended for high schoolers were expensive and inaccessible. Still, I struggled, persevered, and learned as much as I could, never forgetting my path of difficulties. This is why I started All in AI. Research demonstrates that exposure to AI education prior to college exponentially raises the chance that students go on to pursue related careers. How can an AI revolution happen if many of those impacted are left behind? All In AI bridges this gap</p>

            <p class="contentp">All my life I heard about this cool, new, tech thing on the rise called AI. I had no understanding of what it was, but I really wanted to learn more. I was pretty young thought so I never thought to look into it more on the internet. Soon the interest died since I did not know where to start. Then I discovered All In AI. The course inspired me to look more into AI. From videos on reinforment learning to Kaggle courses I can't get enough learning about this under-explored field. Now I want to help others find a similar passion in AI</p>

            <p class="contentp">I have been programming for 6 years and am familiar with Python, C, and to some extent, C++. Iâ€™ve been working with Aadi and python-based machine learning systems and have been very impressed with the possibilities that come with this pretty simple to understand technology. With All In AI, my hope is to be able to teach others about this awesome technology, as well as computer science in general, as well as create interactive hardware implementations that can demonstrate interesting applications of machine learning</p>
