# All-In-AI-website-v2
HTML website created based off edited Canva template
No dependencies required since just html css currently. Just git clone and run with live server.

What html pages use what css pages? (So you don't have to hunt them down)
 - index.html (intro page) file uses the styleindex.css for css
 - whyai.html whatwedo.html (two pages with a image and block of text) files use whypages.css
 - tenets.html (three image h4 p divs) file uses tenets.css
 - couretimeline (page title and image of timeline) uses tenets.css 
 - aboutus.html (three image h4 p divs but with black background) uses aboutus.css
 - contact.html (two text blocks and image on same vertical level) uses contact.css

How could this website be better?
 - Animations would be nice
 - The three tenets and three people divs are aligned in a really unscalable way
 - A logo in the head would be nice
